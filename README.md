# Techdegree_project_8


#Previously made in projcet 6:

As part of your job, you’ve been asked to build a website that displays information about various minerals (AKA rocks). The home page of the site contains a list of all of the minerals in a database. Clicking on a mineral’s name opens a page that displays information about the mineral.

A web designer has already designed the pages. You only need to write the code to created the pages as they’ve been designed. Use the included HTML/CSS files to see how to structure and style the pages. You don’t need to alter global.css - just use it as is.


#In this project:

Add features to a web application that catalogs minerals to build a fully-featured web site. Add the ability to search information and filter it to match user preferences.
